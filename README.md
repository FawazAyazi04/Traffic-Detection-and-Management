This project, titled " Traffic management Using Intelligent Techniques" focuses on improving traffic management, and solving complex traffic scenarios by using advanced deep learning techniques. Utilizing YOLOv4 and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the project aims to develop a sophisticated system for real-time traffic detection and management. 
The primary goals are to analyse traffic patterns, identify congestion, and deploy strategies for dynamic traffic flow management. Extensive datasets, including CCTV footage from the New Zealand Transport Agency, serve as the foundation for training and evaluating the system. This dataset was taken from the paper "Towards Real-time Traffic Flow Estimation using YOLO and SORT from Surveillance Video Footage".
Core elements of the project include object detection with YOLOv4, object tracking using the SORT algorithm, and real-time communication via Twilio for alert notifications. The results indicate a promising potential for enhancing urban traffic efficiency, reducing congestion, and increasing road safety. Future enhancements will aim to scale the system, incorporate advanced algorithms like YOLOv8, and expand its capabilities to include pedestrian and cyclist traffic management, integration with smart city technologies, and environmental monitoring, thus offering a comprehensive solution to modern urban traffic management challenges.â€ƒ
